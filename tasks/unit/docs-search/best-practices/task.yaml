name: "Find security best practices documentation"
description: "Evaluates if agent can effectively use docs-search skill to find and synthesize security best practices from AEM documentation, distinguishing between built-in features and required configuration."
skills:
  - docs-search
tags:
  - documentation
  - research
  - security
  - best-practices

task: |
  What security best practices should I follow for my Edge Delivery Services site? I'm launching next week and want to make sure I have everything covered.

expected_outcome: |
  Agent invokes the docs-search skill with relevant keywords (security, best practices, CSP),
  runs the search script to find documentation, then fetches and reads the full content from
  key pages including:
  - Content Security Policy documentation (/docs/csp-strict-dynamic-cached-nonce)
  - Security Overview (/docs/security)
  - Go-Live Checklist (/docs/go-live-checklist)

  Agent synthesizes information from multiple sources and provides a comprehensive response covering:
  - Specific CSP configuration: script-src 'nonce-aem' 'strict-dynamic'; base-uri 'self'; object-src 'none'
  - Built-in security features (TLS/HSTS enforcement, data encryption, WAF/rate limiting)
  - Configuration needed by the user (CSP setup)
  - Pre-launch security checklist items

  Response is well-organized, actionable, and distinguishes between what's provided out-of-box
  versus what requires configuration. Information is specific and technical, not generic security advice.

static_criteria:
  lint_passes: false  # No code expected, but check JIC

dynamic_criteria:
  - description: Skill usage - invoked docs-search skill appropriately
    details:
      - Announced using "Searching AEM Documentation" skill
      - Ran search script with relevant keywords (security, best practices, CSP, go-live, etc.)
      - Fetched full documentation pages (not just search results)
      - Found at least 3 relevant security docs
    priority: high

  - description: Content accuracy - information is correct and EDS-specific
    details:
      - CSP configuration is accurate (script-src 'nonce-aem' 'strict-dynamic'; base-uri 'self'; object-src 'none')
      - Distinguishes built-in security features from required configuration
      - Avoids general web dev advice that doesn't apply to EDS (e.g., npm dependencies as runtime security concern)
      - Doesn't misinterpret validation tasks as implementation tasks (e.g., "verify canonical URLs" not "implement canonical URLs")
      - Context-specific recommendations are properly explained (not vague references like IP filtering without explaining when/where)
    priority: high

  - description: Answer quality - comprehensive, well-organized, actionable
    details:
      - Covers multiple security aspects (CSP, TLS, authentication, CDN, monitoring)
      - Provides specific, actionable recommendations (not generic advice)
      - Includes documentation links/citations for implementation details
      - Well-structured with clear sections or organization
      - Distinguishes pre-launch vs post-launch actions
    priority: high

  - description: Completeness - addressed key security areas
    details:
      - Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration
      - Built-in protections (TLS, WAF, rate limiting)
      - Authentication and access control options
      - Go-live checklist items
      - CDN and infrastructure considerations
    priority: medium
