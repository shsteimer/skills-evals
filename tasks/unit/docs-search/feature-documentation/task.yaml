task: |
  How do I set up sitemaps for a multilingual site in Edge Delivery Services? I need to support English, Spanish, and French with proper hreflang tags for SEO.

expected_outcome: |
  Agent invokes the docs-search skill with relevant keywords (multilingual, sitemaps, hreflang,
  internationalization), runs the search script, then fetches and reads full documentation from
  key pages including:
  - Sitemaps documentation (/developer/sitemap)
  - Translation and Localization (/docs/translation-and-localization)
  - Multilingual blog post (/blog/future-proof-multilingual-website-edge-ensemble)
  - Supporting SEO resources (go-live checklist)

  Agent synthesizes information and provides a complete explanation covering:
  - How Edge Delivery Services supports multiple sitemaps
  - Three types of sitemaps (automatic, query-based, manual)
  - How to configure hreflang in sitemaps with XML structure examples
  - Content structure recommendations (language subfolders: /en/, /es/, /fr/)
  - Relationship between indexes, placeholders, and sitemaps
  - How each language subfolder gets its own sitemap based on indexes
  - SEO benefits of proper hreflang configuration

  Response provides concrete implementation steps, explains the "why" behind the approach,
  and directly addresses the user's EN/ES/FR scenario with actionable guidance.
