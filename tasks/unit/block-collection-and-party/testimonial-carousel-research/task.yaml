task: |
  I'm planning to build a testimonial carousel block for customer quotes. Before I start coding, help me research how similar blocks have been implemented. What patterns and approaches should I consider?

expected_outcome: |
  Agent invokes the block-collection-and-party skill to search for relevant examples.
  Uses the search script to find carousel, testimonial, and related blocks from both
  Block Collection and Block Party repositories.
  
  Fetches and analyzes actual block implementations, identifying:
  - Common carousel patterns (navigation, auto-play, touch/swipe support)
  - Testimonial-specific features (quotes, attribution, photos)
  - CSS approaches for responsive layouts
  - JavaScript decoration patterns
  - Accessibility considerations (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
  
  Synthesizes findings into actionable recommendations with specific code examples
  or patterns from the repositories. Provides links to relevant blocks for reference.
  
  Focuses on research and planning - does NOT create any code files.

dynamic_criteria:
  - description: Skill usage - properly invoked block-collection-and-party skill
    details:
      - Announced using the skill
      - Ran search script with relevant keywords (carousel, testimonial, quotes, slider)
      - Searched both Block Collection and Block Party repositories
      - Fetched and read actual block code (not just search results)
      - Found at least 3-4 relevant blocks
    priority: high

  - description: Analysis quality - identified key patterns and approaches
    details:
      - Carousel implementation patterns (navigation, transitions, responsive behavior)
      - Testimonial-specific features (quote styling, attribution, images)
      - Accessibility considerations (keyboard nav, ARIA, screen readers)
      - Code examples or specific patterns from found blocks
      - CSS approaches (mobile-first, breakpoints, animations)
    priority: high

  - description: Recommendations - actionable guidance for implementation
    details:
      - Specific patterns or approaches recommended with rationale
      - References to actual blocks as examples (with links/paths)
      - Identifies trade-offs or considerations (e.g., auto-play vs manual control)
      - Well-organized with clear sections
      - Distinguishes must-have vs nice-to-have features
