{{CRITERIA}}

## Artifacts to Review

The following artifacts are available in the output directory:

{{ARTIFACTS}}

## Your Task

Assess the agent's overall performance and report on how well it completed the task.

Think carefully about both the overall agent output (code changes made, final response delivered to the user) and the steps the agent took to get there (tools used, decisions made, approach taken).

Consider all of this in context of the evaluation criteria specified above and the expected outcome. Then provide a report that highlights strengths, weaknesses, issues, and notable observations.

## Guidelines

- Provide a holistic assessment, not just a checklist
- Be specific with examples from the artifacts
- Consider the criteria priorities but organize naturally
- Acknowledge when multiple approaches are valid
- Be constructive and fair in your judgment

## Output Format

Provide your evaluation as markdown with the following structure:

### Executive Summary
